I am a recent-ish IT security enthusiast dedicated to solving complex problems and breaking stuff in VM's.

## Objective

Computers captured my heart ever since my dad brought home an old Amiga when I was a kid. About three years ago I decided to break into the IT field. Now, Iâ€™m focused on developing my cybersecurity/admin skills and am particularly interested in the blue team side of things, with possible plans to explore malware analysis in the future.
