## Introduction

Computers captured my heart ever since my dad brought home an old Amiga when I was a kid. About three years ago, I decided to switch career paths and break into the IT field. I’m a relatively new cybersec enthusiast, dedicated to solving complex problems and experimenting with breaking things in virtual machines.

## Objective

I’m focused on developing my cybersecurity and administration skills, with a particular interest in the blue team side of things and potential plans to explore malware analysis in the future.

## Projects
- **<a href="https://github.com/GrzegorzL-lab/Detection-Lab/tree/main">Detection Lab</a>** set up in VirtualBox with two virtual NICs (one NAT and one internal network), utilizing Kali, REMnux, and FlareVM, with baseline snapshots configured. The lab includes both vulnerable and hardened Windows/Unix agents for hands-on exploration, with a non-Windows host OS providing an additional defensive layer against malware.
